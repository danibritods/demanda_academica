# Project to automatize the students demands for academic subjects in UENF's Computer Science course.
This project exist because our academic system currently does not offer a clear vizualization of the student's aggregate demand for subjects.
In that regard, my friend @Jo√£o and I thought about a feaseble way to help our coordinator.
The idea is to automatically extract information from pdfs about attendance and prerequisites to map the exact necessity of each subject by the number of student currently needing them. 

The project is specially relevant in the context of our exception period during the pandemics which brings a layer of complexity to the academic system consider demand. 

Finally this is hopefully a small first step towards a data driven culture that is more precise and confortable to the faculty and staff.
